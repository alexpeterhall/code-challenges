# Two Characters

## Problem statement

- Given a string, remove characters until the string is made up of any two alternating characters. When you choose a character to remove, all instances of that character must be removed. Determine the longest string possible that contains just two alternating letters.

- Assume the input will always be a string of lower-case letters.

- Return the length (number) of the longest possible two-character alternating string. Return zero if no match is possible.
